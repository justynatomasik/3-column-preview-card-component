## My process

I started with the mobile layout, using CSS Flexbox to arrange the cards, while CSS Grid is applied to the body. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge gave me an opportunity to practice using Flexbox. I also wanted to add a sticky footer with credits, so I explored CSS Grid as well. This was my first experience with media queries and responsive design, and I learned more about various CSS units.

### Continued development

Try something more challenging and learn more.
